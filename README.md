# March-Madness-Matchup-Predictor
This program first scrapes the KenPom website (https://kenpom.com/) for valuable data including adjusted offensive (AdjO) and defensive (AdjD) efficiency, as well as adjusted tempo (AdjT). It then uses the Pythagorean Expected Winning Percentage (pythag) and Log5 methods to determine the probability of any college basketball team (listed on KenPom) winning against the other, given the values listed above. Also calculates expected score for the game given adjusted tempo (AdjT) and adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency, as well as expected point return for predicting either team to win (including bonuses for upsets/higher seeds winning). Enjoy!
