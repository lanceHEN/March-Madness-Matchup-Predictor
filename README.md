# March-Madness-Matchup-Predictor
This program first parses a Kenpom html file for valuable data including adjusted offensive (AdjO) and defensive (AdjD) efficiency, as well as adjusted tempo (AdjT). It then uses the Pythagorean Expected Winning Percentage (pythag) and Log5 methods to determine the probability of any college basketball team (listed on KenPom) winning against the other, given the values listed above. Also calculates expected score for the game given adjusted tempo (AdjT) and adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency, as well as expected point return for predicting either team to win (including bonuses for upsets/higher seeds winning). Enjoy! NOTE: There are two files: a new one and an old one. The old one requires user to enter name and then seed (i.e 1. Gonzaga 2. 1) whereas the second requires user to enter name and seed at the same time(i.e. Gonzaga 1). This is done because KenPom adds each team's seed to their title during March Madness, rather than making another column for official seeds. Just make another column please KenPom!

*this used to scrape Kenpom, but now it blocks HTTP requests, so you have to grab the html file and store it on your local machine
